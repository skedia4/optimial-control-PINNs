## Differential Drive optimal control via HJB PINNS and non-linear optimization using single shooting method

#### Notes:
* suffix 'mod_1' are trained with M, Q, R as Identity matrix meaning equal weightage.

* suffix 'mod_2' are trained with M= 3I, Q= 6I, R = 0.5I. where I is Identity matrix. This setting currently works best.
